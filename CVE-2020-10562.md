### DEVOME GRR ###

The **DEVOME GRR before 3.4.1c** is vulnerable to a file upload restriction bypass that allow remote code execution.


To exploit this vulnerability an attacker must be authenticated with admin privileges. 

On the resource's edit page (**admin_edit_room.php**), he can bypass the image upload control using a malicious php script
with the extensions "*****.php.png*****", "*****.php.gif*****" or "*****.php.jpg*****" and get code execution by accessingthe uploaded php script 
in the directory **/images/**. 

The name of the script on the server is displayed on the **admin_edit_room.php** after being uploaded.
