### DEVOME GRR ###

The **DEVOME GRR before 3.4.1c** is vulnerable to an sql injection, that can be exploited unauthenticated.

On the page **/frmcontactlist.php**, the GET **id** parameter isn't correctly sanitized allowing an attacker to inject sql commands.


**PoC:**
```
http://vulnerable/frmcontactlist.php?id=0' union select schema_name, 2 from information_schema.schemata %23
```

If an attacker is able to retrieve and crack an admin password hash (MD5) from the database, 
he can then exploit the vulnerability [CVE-2020-10562](https://github.com/skr0x/CVE/tree/master/CVE-2020-10562) and obtain remote code execution on the hosting system.
